This folder will not be as up to date as MinGW folder (which is not up to date, anyway).

Note, some duplicate headers from MinGW version will NOT be added in VC's include/ - e.g. lib3ds. Copy the lib3ds/ folder from MinGW variant to over here.

If any other file is missing, please Google it up or compile it yourself. GLICT is not officially supported under MSVC anymore, patches welcome.

Also read instructions for MinGW folder, some apply to MSVC too.
