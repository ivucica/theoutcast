THE OUTCAST 0.4 - GNU/Linux VERSION
Readme for 0.4.1
(c) 2005-2007 OBJECT Networks
=============================

Hi,
here are some addon notes regarding GNU/Linux version.

1) Installation

$ tar xvvfz outcast*
$ cd outcast<PRESS TAB>
$ ./outcast

2) Requirements

Built with Debian GNU/Linux testing.

You will need the following libraries:
* FreeGLUT
* Lib3DS
* SQLite3
* GMP

To make sound work, you will also need set of programs called "SoX - Swiss army knife of sound processing"; more specifically, a program called "play" which will accept one argument - the file name to be played. This program is included in SoX.

3) Known limitations

* It cannot run under "Debian GNU/Linux March 17th 2007 etch-testing" on Intel 915GM motherboard when Compiz is running.
* While dragging, cursor position is not read properly so you can't see where the cursor exactly is.
