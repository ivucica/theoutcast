=============================

Hi,
here are some addon notes regarding GNU/Linux version.

1) Installation

$ tar xvvfz outcast*
$ cd outcast<PRESS TAB>
$ ./outcast

2) Known limitations

* It cannot run under "Debian GNU/Linux March 17th 2007 etch-testing" on Intel 915GM motherboard when Compiz is running.
* While dragging, cursor position is not read properly so you can't see where the cursor exactly is.
