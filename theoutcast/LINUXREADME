THE OUTCAST 0.4 - GNU/Linux VERSION
Readme for 0.4.1
(c) 2005-2007 OBJECT Networks
=============================

Hi,
here are some addon notes regarding GNU/Linux version. Please also read file
readme.txt.

1) Installation

$ tar xvvfz outcast*
$ cd outcast<PRESS TAB>
$ ./outcast

Under Debian and Ubuntu, run this to install required packages:
# apt-get install libglut3 libsqlite3-0 libgmp3c2 sox xdialog

2) Requirements

Built with Debian GNU/Linux testing.

You will need the following libraries:
* FreeGLUT
* Lib3DS
* SQLite3
* GMP

To make sound work, you will also need set of programs called "SoX - Swiss
army knife of sound processing"; more specifically, a program called "play"
which will accept one argument - the file name to be played. It needs to be
able to play WAV files. Such program is included in SoX, that's why it's
recommended.

To make message boxes work, you'll need a program called xdialog. It needs
to accept arguments -center, -title followed by the titlebar text for the
messagebox, and additional argument containing messagebox text. Such a
program can be found in package xdialog. (Note: we're talking about X-based
message boxes, not GLICT based message boxes.)

3) Known limitations

* It cannot run under "Debian GNU/Linux March 17th 2007 etch-testing" on Intel
  915GM motherboard when Compiz is running.
* While dragging, cursor position is not read properly so you can't see where
  the cursor exactly is.

4) Feature differences from Windows version

* Under GNU/Linux there is additional command line argument "softwarerenderer"
  is accepted. See readme.txt for more info.
* Background music is not supported.
